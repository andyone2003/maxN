maxN my first repository
=============

Hi, there!
I'm Andy.
People call me Andy.
This is my first repository.
I'm now getting ready to attend lots of interviews.
So I start to get ready by writing my code in github.
Here I come.

You have any problem please contact andyone2003@gmail.com

This program in C language is to find the max N numbers in a long list stored in a file named test.txt.
